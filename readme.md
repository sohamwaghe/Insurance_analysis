Retail Sales Analysis & Strategic Report (2022-2025)

Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis of a retail sales dataset spanning from January 2022 to January 2025. The primary objective of this project was to analyze transactional data to identify key sales trends, understand customer behavior, and uncover actionable insights to drive strategic business growth.

The analysis culminates in a detailed strategic report and an interactive Power BI dashboard, both of which are included in this repository.

Key Strategic Insights
The analysis revealed several key insights that form the basis of our strategic recommendations:

Market Stability & Brand Loyalty: The business demonstrates a stable market position with consistent daily revenue, pointing to a loyal customer base rather than volatile, trend-driven sales.

A Diversified and Resilient Portfolio: Revenue is well-distributed across multiple product categories, with 'Butchers' and 'Electric household essentials' leading. This diversification mitigates risk and provides a resilient revenue foundation.

The Omnichannel Advantage: Sales are almost perfectly split between Online (51%) and In-store (49%) channels, indicating a successful and balanced business model that effectively caters to the modern consumer.

Broad Demographic Appeal: Customer payment preferences are evenly distributed among Cash, Digital Wallet, and Credit Card, demonstrating that the business appeals to a wide demographic with varied financial habits.

Tools and Technologies
