📊 Medical Insurance Cost Analysis & Prediction
🔎 Project Overview

This project analyzes the Medical Insurance Cost Dataset (1,338 records) to explore how demographic and lifestyle factors (age, BMI, smoking, region, etc.) impact insurance charges.

It combines:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) → uncovering insights through statistical analysis & visualizations.

Predictive Modeling → building regression models to forecast medical charges.

Dashboarding (Power BI) → presenting results in an executive, decision-friendly format.

👉 Goal: Showcase data analyst skills — from cleaning to insights to business storytelling — in a corporate-ready style.

📂 Dataset

Source: Kaggle — Medical Cost Personal Dataset

Rows: 1,338 individuals

Features:

age → Age of individual

sex → Male/Female

bmi → Body Mass Index

children → Number of dependents

smoker → Smoker status (Yes/No)

region → Residential area in the US

charges → Medical insurance cost billed (Target)

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn) → Data cleaning, EDA, regression modeling

Power BI → Dashboard creation & business insights

Jupyter/Colab → Analysis & documentation

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key insights discovered:

Smokers pay 3x more on average than non-smokers.

BMI strongly impacts charges: Obese individuals face ~45% higher costs.

Age is positively correlated with charges — older individuals pay more.

Regional differences are minor, but Southeast tends to have higher costs.

Visualizations include:

Age distribution by smoker status

BMI distribution across categories

Charges distribution (log-transformed)

📈 Power BI Dashboard

Created a 3-page dashboard:

Executive Overview → KPIs + high-level trends

Risk Factor Analysis → Impact of smoking, obesity, and age

Predictive Insights → Model performance & feature importance
